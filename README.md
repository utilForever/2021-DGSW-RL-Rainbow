# 2021-DGSW-RL-Rainbow

2021-DGSW-RL-Rainbow is the material(lecture notes, examples and assignments) repository for learning from the basic knowledge of Reinforcement Learning to Rainbow DQN course that I'll teach students at Daegu Software High School in the fall of 2021. Note that examples and assignments in this repository uses [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).
